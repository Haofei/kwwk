# kwwk

A Swift-native coding agent with two faces:

- **`kwwk`** — an interactive coding CLI (TUI) that drives your existing
  Anthropic, ChatGPT (Codex), or GitHub Copilot subscription — or an API
  key for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google (Gemini), OpenRouter, or any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **`KWWKAgent` / `KWWKAI`** — the agent runtime underneath, exposed as
  SwiftPM libraries so you can embed it in your own app, build custom
  tools, or swap the LLM provider.

## Requirements

- macOS 14+
- Swift 6.1 toolchain (Xcode 16.3+ or the matching `swift` toolchain)

---

## 1. The coding CLI

### Install

From Homebrew (recommended):

```sh
brew install EYHN/tap/kwwk
```

Or build from source:

```sh
swift build -c release
cp .build/release/kwwk /usr/local/bin/
```

### Run

```
kwwk              launch the interactive coding TUI
kwwk --help       show this message
```

Credentials come from the OAuth store at `~/.kwwk/oauth.json`; if no login
exists, the CLI checks supported API-key environment variables. With
neither configured, kwwk starts logged out — launch it and run `/login`
to sign in to a provider (OAuth subscription like ChatGPT Codex, Copilot,
or Claude Code; or an API key for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google (Gemini),
OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

Inside the TUI, `/help` lists slash commands (`/model`, `/thinking`,
`/clear`, …). The agent ships with Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Find,
LS, and background-task tools out of the box. SDK callers that want tmux
must opt into `.tmux` or `.allIncludingTmux` and provide an explicit
`TmuxSessionManager`.

---

## 2. The agent SDK

Add `kwwk` as a SwiftPM dependency:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/EYHN/kwwk", branch: "main"),
```

Then depend on the libraries you need:

```swift
.product(name: "KWWKAgent", package: "kwwk"),
.product(name: "KWWKAI",    package: "kwwk"),
```

- **`KWWKAI`** — model clients, provider registry, streaming, OAuth,
  message / tool types.
- **`KWWKAgent`** — the turn/tool loop, built-in coding tools, hooks.

The SDK does not read `~/.kwwk` or process environment variables by
default. Pass credentials, session stores, context files, and skill
directories explicitly. The `kwwk` binary is the layer that opts into
`~/.kwwk/*` and environment-key discovery.

### Quick start — one-shot run

`Agent.runOnce` mirrors `query()` in the Python Agent SDK: a fresh agent
runs a single prompt and yields every event as an async stream.

```swift
import KWWKAI
import KWWKAgent

// 1. Register a provider using an API key.
let anthropicAPIKey = "sk-ant-..."
await registerBuiltins(anthropic: anthropicAPIKey)

// 2. Build a coding agent scoped to a working directory.
let agent = try await makeCodingAgent(CodingAgentConfig(
    model: Models.claudeSonnet5,
    cwd: FileManager.default.currentDirectoryPath,
    tools: .readOnly,
    bashEnvironment: [:]
)).agent

// 3. Drive it.
try await agent.prompt("Summarize the Swift files under Sources/KWWKAgent.")

// 4. Read the transcript.
for message in agent.state.messages {
    print(message)
}
```

### Subagents

`CodingAgentConfig.subagents` defaults to an empty array. When it is
empty, `makeCodingAgent` does not register the `agent` tool. Add
subagent definitions explicitly when you want model-driven delegation:

```swift
let reviewer = SubagentDefinition(
    name: "reviewer",
    description: "Use for code quality, security, maintainability, and test coverage review.",
    prompt: """
    You are a senior code reviewer. Review code carefully, do not edit files,
    and report findings with file paths, severity, and concrete evidence.
    """,
    tools: .readOnly,
    model: .inherit
)

let bg = BackgroundTaskManager()
let shellEnvironment = ["PATH": "/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"]
let coding = try await makeCodingAgent(CodingAgentConfig(
    model: Models.claudeSonnet5,
    cwd: FileManager.default.currentDirectoryPath,
    tools: .standard,
    backgroundManager: bg,
    subagents: [reviewer],
    bashEnvironment: shellEnvironment
))

try await coding.agent.prompt("Use the reviewer subagent to review Sources/KWWKAgent.")

// With a backgroundManager, completed background tasks auto-continue the
// agent (new LLM runs start on their own). Call `coding.detachBackground?()`
// to unsubscribe when embedding.
```

For the same built-ins that the CLI uses, SDK users can opt in without
copying prompts:

```swift
let agent = try await makeCodingAgent(CodingAgentConfig(
    model: Models.claudeSonnet5,
    cwd: FileManager.default.currentDirectoryPath,
    tools: .standard,
    backgroundManager: BackgroundTaskManager(),
    bashEnvironment: shellEnvironment
).withBuiltinSubagents([.general, .explore, .plan])).agent
```

SDK users can also run a subagent directly:

```swift
let runner = SubagentRunner(
    cwd: FileManager.default.currentDirectoryPath,
    subagents: [.plan()],
    parentModel: Models.claudeSonnet5,
    parentTools: .readOnly,
    bashEnvironment: [:]
)
let result = try await runner.run(
    type: "Plan",
    prompt: "Plan how to simplify Sources/KWWKAgent/SubagentTool.swift."
)
```

Subagents are fresh-context agents: they do not inherit the parent
transcript. The parent model must put the relevant files, errors, goals,
and constraints into the `agent` tool's `prompt`. Subagents inherit the
parent model, tools when `SubagentDefinition.tools` is nil, thinking
level, retry delay, and API key resolver, but they do not inherit parent
hooks such as `betweenTurns`, `transformContext`, `convertToLlm`,
`userPromptSubmit`, or tool-call hooks.

Each subagent run gets its own child session id. Tools inside that
subagent, including background-capable tools such as Bash, are scoped to
the child session. While the child agent is running, background task
notifications are attached to that child session. When the subagent
finishes or is cancelled, the generic background-task session is closed:
still-running tasks in that child session are killed and queued
notifications for that child session are discarded. If the parent starts
the subagent itself with `run_in_background`, that top-level subagent job
remains parent-visible so `wait_task` and completion notifications still
work.

In the interactive TUI, foreground subagent tool calls update their
in-flight display with the child agent's token usage as it runs. When a
provider does not stream exact usage until the end of the turn, the live
counter falls back to an approximate output-token estimate and is
replaced by provider-reported usage once available.

Subagent tools also emit structured runtime events through
`AgentEvent.runtimeEvent(.subagent(...))`: started, tool update,
background started, completed, and failed. The terminal
`AgentRunSummary.subagents` array records each foreground child run's
usage, cost, turns, duration, status, model, and child session id.
Background subagents are recorded when the parent-visible background task
is started; their completion is delivered through the existing
background-task notification flow.

The interactive `kwwk` CLI enables a small built-in set by default:
`general`, `Explore`, and `Plan`. `general` inherits the parent agent's
tools and is used when the model omits `subagent_type`. `Explore` and
`Plan` are read-only specialists. Use `--no-subagents` to disable them or
`--subagents general,Explore` to enable only a subset. The SDK does not
enable those automatically.

When an SDK application is done with an agent session, call
`await agent.closeSession()` to release provider-owned resources keyed by
that session id. For OpenAI Responses WebSocket transport, this closes the
stored WebSocket connection for the session.

### Streaming events

Subscribe before prompting to observe tokens, tool calls, and the final
summary as they happen:

```swift
let unsubscribe = agent.subscribe { event, _ in
    switch event {
    case .messageUpdate(let assistant, _):
        // Live-render streaming assistant tokens.
        print(assistant.textPreview, terminator: "")
    case .toolExecutionStart(_, let name, let args):
        print("→ \(name) \(args)")
    case .agentEnd(_, let summary):
        print("\n[\(summary.turns) turns · $\(summary.cost.total)]")
    default: break
    }
}
defer { unsubscribe() }

try await agent.prompt("Find all TODOs in this repo.")
```

Or consume `runOnce` as an `AsyncThrowingStream`:

```swift
for try await event in Agent.runOnce(
    prompt: "what's in README.md?",
    options: AgentOptions(initialState: AgentInitialState(
        model: Models.claudeHaiku45,
        tools: [createReadTool(cwd: ".")]
    ))
) {
    if case .messageEnd(let message) = event { print(message) }
}
```

### Custom tools

A tool is a name, a JSON-Schema parameter spec, and an async `execute`
closure. The agent handles validation, cancellation, and wiring the
result back into the transcript.

```swift
import KWWKAI
import KWWKAgent

let weather = AgentTool(
    name: "get_weather",
    label: "weather",
    description: "Look up the current temperature for a city.",
    parameters: [
        "type": "object",
        "properties": [
            "city": ["type": "string", "description": "City name"]
        ],
        "required": ["city"]
    ],
    execute: { _, args, _, _ in
        guard case .object(let obj) = args,
              case .string(let city) = obj["city"] ?? .null else {
            throw CodingToolError.invalidArgument("city required")
        }
        let temp = try await fetchTemp(city)
        return AgentToolResult(content: [.text(.init(text: "\(temp)°C in \(city)"))])
    }
)

let agent = Agent(initialState: AgentInitialState(
    model: Models.claudeSonnet5,
    tools: [weather]
))
try await agent.prompt("Is it warmer in Tokyo or Oslo right now?")
```

### Hooks — audit, redact, short-circuit

Every `AgentOptions` accepts hooks that fire at well-defined points. Use
them to enforce policy without forking the loop:

```swift
let options = AgentOptions(
    initialState: AgentInitialState(model: Models.claudeSonnet5, tools: [...]),
    // Block or rewrite a tool call before it runs.
    beforeToolCall: { ctx, _ in
        if ctx.toolCall.name == "bash",
           case .object(let o) = ctx.args,
           case .string(let cmd) = o["command"] ?? .null,
           cmd.contains("rm -rf") {
            return BeforeToolCallResult(block: true, reason: "destructive command blocked")
        }
        return nil
    },
    // Intercept a user prompt before it enters the transcript.
    userPromptSubmit: { ctx, _ in
        // e.g. redact secrets, inject policy preamble.
        return nil
    }
)
let agent = Agent(options: options)
```

Other hook points: `afterToolCall`, `convertToLlm`, `transformContext`
(for context pruning / summarization).

### Steering a running agent

Queue a message that will be injected at the next turn boundary —
without aborting the current turn:

```swift
Task {
    try await agent.prompt("refactor this module end-to-end")
}

// later, from any thread:
agent.steer("also add tests as you go")
```

### Providers

`registerBuiltins` covers Anthropic, OpenAI (Completions + Responses),
and Google Gemini from explicit keys. For CLI-style environment discovery,
call `registerBuiltinsFromEnvironment(env:)` with an environment snapshot.
`Models` exposes a small curated catalog
(`claudeSonnet5`, `gpt55`, `gemini35Flash`, …) or you can construct
`Model` values by hand. For OpenAI-compatible endpoints (xAI, Groq,
OpenRouter) there are `Models.xaiGrok(id:)`, `Models.groq(id:)`,
`Models.openRouter(id:)` helpers.

To use a subscription (OAuth) token instead of a raw API key, drive the
flow via `KWWKAI.OAuth` / `OAuthLogin` — the same code path the CLI's
in-session `/login` command uses.

### Updating the model catalog

`/model` reads the bundled catalog at
`Sources/KWWKAI/Resources/models.json`, generated from pi-mono's
`packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts`.

```sh
swift run kwwk-generate-models /path/to/pi-mono/packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts
swift test
```

The generator writes `Sources/KWWKAI/Resources/models.json` by default.
The catalog tests assert unsupported Google Gemini CLI and Google
Antigravity provider groups stay absent.

---

## Layout

- `Sources/KWWKAI` — model clients, OAuth, provider adapters
- `Sources/KWWKAgent` — tool-using agent loop and built-in tools
- `Sources/KWWKCli` — interactive TUI, slash commands, rendering
- `Sources/kwwk` — the executable entry point
- `Tests/` — XCTest suites for each module

Run the full package test suite with SwiftPM:

```sh
swift test
```

## A note on OAuth client IDs

`Sources/KWWKAI/OAuthProviders.swift` reuses the OAuth client IDs (and,
where applicable, public app metadata) shipped by the upstream
first-party CLIs — Anthropic's Claude Code, OpenAI's Codex CLI, and
GitHub Copilot's VS Code extension. Those credentials are not secrets in
any meaningful sense — they are embedded in those open-source CLIs and
are required for the "log in with your existing subscription" flow to
work. They remain the property of their respective vendors, who may
rotate or revoke them at any time. `kwwk` is not affiliated with or
endorsed by any of these vendors.
